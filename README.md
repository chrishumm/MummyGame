# MummyGame

MummyGame is a consoel based game written in C++. It supports input from the keyboard and will run on most Windows platforms. The goal of the game is to collect the energy bars that are randomly scattered across the map, whilst avoiding the enemies. You can trap the enemies to get around them. 
Once all the energy bars are collected, you can reach the end of the map.

It is currently in an alpha state and is actively being developed as you read this! If you want to help or contribute, see [below](#support)

# Features

# Getting Started

You can download the exe from the release section. It currently only works on Windows.

## Installing from source (Local)

### System Requirements

:bulb: Before you begin, make sure you have all the below installed:

- A C++ compiler (Either Visual Studio or Code::Blocks for Windows)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git/)

If using Visual Studio, you can use nuget to simplfy integrating allegro, otherwise manually point to the includes and lib folders in your solution.
